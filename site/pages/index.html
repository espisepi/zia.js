### What is Zia.js?

Zia.js is an object-oriented, WebGL-based game framework. Right now it's
focused on graphics. Sound, networking and general-purpose game APIs will be
added later (if there's enough interest).

Zia.js is *not* a graphics engine, and it's *not* a game engine. It could help
with building either of those, but it's not one of those. It is a *framework*
that can be used to build a game, or a game engine.

Just like XNA gave game developers a friendly set of APIs to use to build games
on Windows-based platforms, I'm hoping to do the same for the web with Zia.js.
The analogy with XNA isn't an accident. Just like XNA provided graphics API that were
recognisably built on Direct3D, and yet higher-level and easier than
Direct3D, so Zia.js provides graphics APIs that are built on WebGL.

### Why not use Three.js?

Most sensible people who want to build a game will choose one of the excellent
graphics or game engines already available for WebGL, such as 
[Three.js](http://threejs.org/) or [Babylon.js](http://www.babylonjs.com/). And
so they should. But there is another group of people who like things a bit closer
to the metal (although bear in mind this is Javascript, where you're already so
far from the metal that it's hard to remember what metal even looks like).

Zia.js is for *that* group of people. I'm one of them myself. I spent years
playing around with XNA, and was disappointed when it was cancelled.
But these are exciting times for 3D graphics; WebGL is now supported in all
major browsers, including Internet Explorer and Safari on iOS. Regardless of 
whether it is "the" future for games, WebGL opens up unbelievably exciting 
possibilities.

### Why not use vanilla WebGL?

Great question. If you have experience with OpenGL, then you'll probably
get up and running with WebGL very quickly. But if (like me) you come from
Direct3D / XNA, WebGL will be... perplexing. Its state-based configuration methods,
where you first bind a resource and call global methods that affect whatever
you bound, take some getting used to. If you just want something similar to XNA,
but for WebGL, then Zia.js is for you.

### Why create yet another WebGL framework?

Like I said above, Zia.js is lower-level than Three.js or Babylon.js, and
higher-level than WebGL. There are
[other object-oriented WebGL wrappers](https://www.google.com/search?q=object+oriented+webgl)
out there. I have reviewed some of them, but the ones I looked at either weren't
maintained, or didn't have the type of API I was looking for.

### What does the name mean?

Zia (pronounced zee-yah) stands for Zia Is Acronymed (a little in-joke for
the ex-[XNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA)-ers in the audience).

Zia is also an Arabic name meaning "light", which seems appropriate for a
rendering framework.
