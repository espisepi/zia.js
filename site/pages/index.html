## What is Zia.js?

With Zia, I have borrowed heavily from the XNA framework design, although I have
diverged from it in some places. For example, where Direct3D/XNA and WebGL naming
conventions differ, I have preferred the WebGL terminology ("program",
"fragment shader", etc.).

## Why create yet another WebGL framework?

Zia isn't a graphics engine, or a game engine. It doesn't compete with
[Three.js](http://threejs.org/) or [Babylon.js](http://www.babylonjs.com/) -
both of those are graphics engines, with scene graphs and other higher-level
constructs. Zia simply provides a more friendly API for WebGL.

There are, of course, [other](https://www.google.com/search?q=object+oriented+webgl)
object-oriented WebGL wrappers out there. I have reviewed some of them, but I
couldn't find any that matched my preferences for API design.

## What does the name mean?

Zia (pronounced zee-yah) stands for Zia Is Acronymed (a little in-joke for
the ex-[XNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA)-ers in the audience).

Zia is also an Arabic name meaning "light", which seems appropriate for a
rendering framework.
